🚨 Why I Had to Yeet vSphere for Proxmox 🚨
A Cautionary Tale of Licensing Greed and Corporate Shenanigans
Once upon a time, VMware was a beacon of enterprise virtualization. It had quirks, sure, but you could at least afford to experiment with it, test in a homelab, and build something meaningful without selling your soul to a megacorp. Then Broadcom came along and, well... let's just say things went downhill faster than a vMotion without vSAN.

🏛️ Before Broadcom (The Golden-ish Age)
VMUG Advantage was a fantastic deal for homelabbers, small businesses, and IT pros who wanted to stay sharp on VMware tech without breaking the bank. For about $200 per year, you got:

✅ 365-day evaluation licenses for a boatload of VMware products, including:

vSphere (including vCenter, ESXi, and Enterprise Plus features)
NSX (for those brave enough to dive into virtual networking hell)
vSAN (because why use expensive SANs when you can make a hyperconverged mess yourself?)
Horizon (VDI, for when you really hate yourself)
💾 Fully functional lab environment – No artificial restrictions, no VM limits, just a "non-production" license. Meaning if you happened to run a startup or small business on it… well, nobody was really checking.

🎓 VMware Training Discounts – Because learning should be accessible, and not just for people with a Fortune 500 budget.

💰 After Broadcom (The Dark Timeline)
Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware was like Thanos snapping half of the virtualization industry out of existence. The new regime immediately axed perpetual licenses, affordable options, and anything remotely resembling a good deal. And, of course, they went after VMUG Advantage too.

🚫 VMUG Advantage no longer includes vSphere – Yep. The core reason why 99% of people signed up for VMUG is gone. No ESXi, no vCenter, no Enterprise Plus. Your "advantage" now? Knowing when to jump ship.

🚫 No NSX, No vSAN – Because why let homelabbers and small IT teams learn their products when they can force everyone into hyper-expensive "enterprise agreements"?

🤡 "Cloud-Only Future" – VMware under Broadcom seems dead set on pushing customers to their subscription-based cloud services, leaving small users with exactly zero viable options.

💸 Enterprise License Agreements (ELAs) or Bust – If you aren’t a multi-million-dollar corporation, Broadcom doesn’t want your business. You must now buy massively overpriced per-core subscriptions to get access to the same software you used to run on a VMUG license.

🪦 Hobbyists, Small Businesses, and Homelabbers: R.I.P. – Broadcom’s strategy seems to be: “If you aren’t paying us a fortune, we don’t care if you leave.”

🏃 The Great Migration to Proxmox (or Anything That Isn't VMware)
When Broadcom ripped the rug out from under the VMUG community, IT pros worldwide scrambled to escape the sinking ship. For us, it meant:

🔄 Migrating from vSphere to Proxmox – Because open-source virtualization doesn’t randomly decide to extort its users overnight.

💾 Ceph for storage – Because now we control our own data, instead of being forced into vSAN’s overpriced ecosystem.

☁️ Exploring alternatives like XCP-ng, Harvester, and KVM-based solutions – Because choice is good and Broadcom doesn’t believe in that.

🔥 Telling VMware to get bent – Because we refuse to pay Broadcom’s ransom just
to virtualize a few servers.
